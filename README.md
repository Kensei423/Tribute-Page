This is a Tribute Page about Jon Foreman for FreeCodeCamp project


I'm spending a lot of time trying to learn to code. I found FreeCodeCamp and it seems like an intresting 
path to take. So far I have a pretty good understanding of HTML and CSS. I also have an understanding of use for the 
framework Bootstrap.
